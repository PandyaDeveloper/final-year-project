# Sentiment Analysis

## Abstract
<ul>
  <li><p align="justify"> Sentiment analysis refers to the task of natural language processing to determine whether a piece of text contains some subjective information and what subjective information it expresses, i.e., whether the attitude behind this text is  positive,  negative or neutral. Understanding the opinions behind user-generated content automatically is of great help for commercial and political use, among others. The task can be conducted on different levels, classifying the polarity of words, sentences or entire documents.</p></li>

If any post has negative score after a certain value which is set by the companyâ€™s law or rules then the post will not be sent to the feeders.</p></li>
